# About me

![](kristal.jpg)

**Clinical Research Coordinator, Columbia University, NY**

     The research I work on is most closely realted to blood pressure and how we can best measure blood pressure in clinical and non clinical settings. 
     The blood preassure devices I am currently using are the ABPM and HBPM monitors developed by Microlife, the ABPM monitor developed by Spacelabs, and the OMRON device.
